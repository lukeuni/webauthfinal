            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>CMP1130M web authoring assessment was to create a responsive website for a band or brand utilising multimedia, advanced interactions and local storage while ensuring use of appropriate web standards ensuring maximum interoperability also allowing the user to customise or interact with the website in some way. 
            In my report I will discuss how best practice was applied and the current strengths and weaknesses of web standards.  </p>
        </div>
         <div class="report4">
             <h1>BEST PRACTICE RESEARCH</h1>
             <p>During my websites development modern browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome and Edge have done a good job at parsing my inexperienced code, however some of my errors were not always caught gracefully and different browsers were not always able to handle my errors in a similar fashion. Using standard, interoperable mark up and stylesheets, on the other hand offers a much greater chance of having ones page handled consistently across different platforms.<br>
                 <br>
             HTML has gone through many different iterations progressing from HTML 1.0 to the current iteration HTML 5.0 which is now supported by most browsers. W3C has helped pave the way for fewer compatibility issues by creating a standard across the web, ensuring greater compatibility across different browsers. W3C’s general message is ‘Be smart and future proof’ using a consistent style keeping your code tidy, clean and well-formed. It is now expected that browsers conform to the W3C’s standards as much as possible to ensure unvarying outcomes across different browsers. One of the main advantages of current standards is that they are backwards compatible allowing HTML 5 to support legacy mark-up such as HTML4 whereas previously XHTML 2.0 was not backwards compatible eventually leading to its downfall. W3C also offer a validator which developers can use to check their code is compliant with current web standards and this became an invaluable tool in my sites development and was key in teaching me good practices. <br>
                 <br>
             However, this is not always the case, there are times when new developments have been made in the mark-up of HTML which browsers are not quick enough to support, creating some compatibility issues and it could be argued for this reason to use older web specifications to ensure maximum compatibility across the web. This is a problem I faced first hand when deciding to use the CSS grid method which I will discuss in more detail later. <br>
                 <br>
             Below are some examples of best practices in web development.

            <h1>FILE STRUCTURE</h1>
            <p>File structure, correct naming conventions and organisation is extremely important. I was guilty of designing in the browser, snatching images online, downloading them and sticking them straight into my code to see what the image looked like. In principle this is ok however there was several occasions in which I forgot to go back and rename my files and didn’t follow a logical organised structure which resulted in me spending 40 minutes renaming and appending my code, something that could have been avoided. If left unchecked this could have resulted in uploading images that weren’t being used making my website less efficient. <br>
                <br>    
            While researching best practices I came across the BEM CSS methodology which I tried to incorporate into my naming conventions. BEM method states that it is an easy method for scaling websites, but I personally preferred the readability of this structure over other methods.
